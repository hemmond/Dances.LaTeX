This dance will be found particularly useful, where there happens to be a large majority of either ladies or gentlemen. The party being placed as above, in lines of three, a gent, and two ladies, or a lady and two gents, the dance proceeds in the same way as the Mescolanzes, except that no change of places is to be made either at the top or bottom of the same,
